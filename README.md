### Technical Implementation Guidelines

#### Required Technical Capabilities
**ZIP Format Knowledge**:
- PKWare ZIP file format specification compliance
- Central directory structure parsing
- Local file header processing
- Compression method handling (store, deflate)

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Binary data parsing and manipulation
- File system operations and data extraction
