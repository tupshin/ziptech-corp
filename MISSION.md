# ZipTech Corporation Mission Statement

## Corporate Objective
**Primary Mission**: Develop and deliver a working zip file parser that can analyze real zip binary files and extract complete file listings without external dependencies.

## Success Criteria Definition

### Technical Requirements
**Core Functionality**:
- Parse PKWare ZIP file format from binary data
- Extract file listings with names, sizes, timestamps, and metadata
- Handle standard compression methods (store, deflate)
- Process central directory and local file headers correctly

**Quality Standards**:
- Works with zip files created by common tools (7zip, WinZip, macOS Archive Utility)
- Handles edge cases (empty files, directories, special characters)
- Validates file integrity and completeness
- Suitable performance for files up to 100MB

### Success Validation Protocol
**Automated Testing Requirements**:
```bash
# Success test execution
./src/zipparser test-file.zip
# Expected output: Complete file listing with metadata
# Success criteria: All files correctly identified without external services
```

**Deliverable Requirements**:
- Executable zip parser in src/zipparser
- Automated test suite in tests/
- Technical documentation in docs/
- Success validation script in validation/

### Corporate Success Metrics
**Mission Completion Indicators**:
- ✅ Working zip parser executable exists
- ✅ Parser correctly processes provided test zip files
- ✅ No external dependencies for core parsing functionality
- ✅ Automated validation confirms success criteria met
- ✅ Professional-quality deliverable suitable for production use
