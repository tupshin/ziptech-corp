### Autonomous Decision Trees

#### Experimentation Decision Matrix
```python
class AutonomousSequencing:
    def phase1_exploration(self):
        """Parallel exploration of multiple approaches"""
        approaches = [
            {"name": "pure_binary", "complexity": "high", "risk": "medium"},
            {"name": "library_assisted", "complexity": "medium", "risk": "low"},
            {"name": "incremental", "complexity": "medium", "risk": "medium"}
        ]
        
        for approach in approaches:
            if self.resource_available() and approach["risk"] != "high":
                self.create_experimental_branch(approach)
                self.assign_team_member(approach)
                
        return self.monitor_parallel_progress()
    
    def phase2_convergence(self):
        """Evaluate experiments and select best approach"""
        results = self.evaluate_all_experiments()
        
        best_approach = max(results, key=lambda x: x["success_score"])
        
        if best_approach["success_score"] > MINIMUM_THRESHOLD:
            self.promote_to_integration(best_approach)
        else:
            self.backtrack_and_replan()
            
        return self.continue_with_selected_approach()
```

### Adaptive Timeline Management
**Dynamic Milestone Adjustment**:
- CEO Architect monitors progress across all experimental branches
- Adjusts timelines based on complexity discoveries
- Reallocates resources from failed experiments to promising approaches
- Maintains overall mission timeline through efficient resource management

### Autonomous Backtracking Protocol
**Smart Backtracking Decisions**:
```
BACKTRACK_TRIGGERS:
  complexity_explosion:
    condition: implementation_time > 2 * estimated_time
    action: preserve_work_and_try_simpler_approach()
    
  technical_impossibility:
    condition: fundamental_blocker_identified
    action: document_limitation_and_switch_approaches()
    
  performance_failure:
    condition: solution_too_slow_for_requirements
    action: optimization_experiments_or_architectural_change()
    
  external_dependency_conflict:
    condition: approach_requires_forbidden_dependencies
    action: pure_implementation_or_alternative_architecture()
```

### Cross-Team Learning Integration
**Knowledge Preservation Across Experiments**:
- Failed experiments contribute insights to successful ones
- Technical discoveries shared across all implementation tracks
- Best practices emerge from comparative experimental analysis
- Evolutionary improvement through preserved learning

This sequencing protocol enables true autonomous problem-solving with sophisticated experimentation, learning, and adaptation capabilities.
